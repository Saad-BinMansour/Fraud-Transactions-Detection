# Fraud Transactions Detection
This is week10 project on Coding Dojo Big Data & AI Bootcamp, it is  simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. 
It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

<strong>Project Goal:</strong> The Porblem is there are transactions frauds that we want to detect. So we will predict fraud transactions using a classification machine learning model using Spark on preprocessing and EDA and Mahcine Learning implmentation. 

The jupyter notebook contains The Preprocessing and EDA and Machine Learning using Pyspark.
